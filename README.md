# Image-Classification-MultiClass
A TensorFlow model categorizes images into multiple classes, processing and training in batches from Google Drive. It evaluates using random batches, storing all metrics in history for analysis, optimizing memory use and allowing iterative model updates.


## Categorizing an image into more than three classes 

Using Python- Tensorflow|Keras|XML|Matplotlib|PIL

How?
- Importing images from google drive
- Processing Images
- Building model using Tensorflow
- The model is trained by loading the images in batches with labels
- A randomly selected batch is loaded the the model is trained and evaluated.
- All training and evaluation metrics are recorded and stored in history for further training analysis.
- This method is memory efficient and allows for iterative updates and evaluations of the modelâ€™s performance
